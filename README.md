# Medical-Insurance-Data-dashboard
A Medical Insurance Cost Data Dashboard Case Study is an analytical project focused on  visualizing, exploring, and understanding factors that influence medical insurance costs (also  called charges or premiums) for individuals. 
It involves building an interactive dashboard that allows users—such as healthcare analysts, 
insurance companies, or policy planners—to analyze how demographic and lifestyle variables 
affect medical insurance charges. 
Purpose / Objectives: 
The main goals of the case study are to: 
1. Analyze the relationship between variables such as age, gender, BMI, number of 
children, smoking status, and region with insurance costs. 
2. Visualize key insights using charts, graphs, and KPIs to make data-driven conclusions. 
3. Identify cost patterns—for example, how smoking or obesity impacts premiums. 
4. Support decision-making for pricing strategies, risk assessment, or health policy design. 
5. Demonstrate data analytics and dashboarding skills using tools like Power BI, Tableau, 
or Python (Dash/Streamlit). 
Dataset Example: 
Typically, the case study uses a dataset like the Medical Cost Personal Dataset (commonly 
available on Kaggle) with columns such as: 
Column 
Age 
Description 
Age of the insured individual 
Sex 
Gender (male/female) 
Bmi Body Mass Index – an indicator of body fat 
Children 
Smoker 
Number of dependents covered by insurance 
Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no) 
Region Residential region (e.g., northeast, northwest, etc.) 
Charges 
Medical insurance cost or premium amount 
Key Dashboard Features: 
KPIs: Average insurance cost, highest/lowest cost, average BMI, smoker ratio, etc. 
Filters: Age range, gender, region, smoker status. 
Visuals: 
Cost distribution by age and BMI 
Charges by region 
Average cost comparison between smokers vs non-smokers 
Correlation heatmap of variables 
Insights section: Highlight trends and business implications. 
Expected Outcomes: 
Identification of key factors driving up insurance costs. 
Insight into demographic trends (e.g., older individuals or smokers pay more). 
A clean, interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore
